  My family decided to go to a Wisconsin Badgers menâ€™s hockey game. 
I had been planning to go to this game for awhile with my family and some family friends so they came to Madison to visit for the weekend. 
I even had to walk for 45 minutes to meet somebody on state street at 8:00 P.M the weekend prior just to get one of the tickets. 
It was worth it though because this weekend was really important to me.
I basically grew up around ice hockey and my family always made it a priority to make it to as many of my games as possible. 

The time had finally come where I had all the tickets prepared and my family and friends had arrived to Madison for the hockey game.
We got to watch the great rivalry between the Minnisota Gophers and the Wisconsin Badgers. This game lived up to the hype and was a 
great time for everyone we got to watch a very close game as both teams would exchange goals several times throughout the game.
It was time for the finally period to begin and the score was tied and everyone was having a blast.
