  My family decided to go to a Wisconsin Badgers menâ€™s hockey game. 
I had been planning to go to this game for awhile with my family and some family friends so they came to Madison to visit for the weekend. 
I even had to walk for 45 minutes to meet somebody on state street at 8:00 P.M the weekend prior just to get one of the tickets. 
It was worth it though because this weekend was really important to me.
I basically grew up around ice hockey and my family always made it a priority to make it to as many of my games as possible.
